Embedded Development Learning Record
This project serves as a personal learning record and is for communication and reference only. 
As I am still in the learning stage, the design of actions is not convenient enough (such as deviations in action trajectories), and there are also many problems in code optimization. 
There may be more unused functions that can achieve detailed control to make gait more perfect.
Finally, I hope this project can provide you with some help.
